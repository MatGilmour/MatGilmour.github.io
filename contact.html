                <h class="aboutmedesc">My name is Mat, and I've just finish my second year at the University of <br>
                    Guelph working towards a bachelor's degree in software engineering. With<br>
                    school taking up most of my time, I never had the opportunity to<br>
                    work on personal projects, so I thought, hey, why don't I make<br>
                    a website? </h>
            </div>
            <div class="contactdesc">
                <h> Through many classes and personal projects or attempts at projects, such as the Waterloo Game Jam, where<br>
                    I learned how to program in unity and C# for three days straight. I also had a class where I learned Perl!<br>
                    Still being in school, I have not had the opportunity to code in a working environment. However, in a lot of <br> 
                    my classes we are required to learn languages in less than a month. 
                </h>

                <h>
                    A little bit ago I had the opportunity to go to Switzerland when my physics team won the Beamline for<br> 
                    Schools competition. Which allowed us the opportunity to learn C and C# alongside researchers from all<br>
                    around the world. While projects are an excellent way do develop my knowledge of programming languages,<br>
                    i'd love the opportunity to learn them in a working environment as well.
